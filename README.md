# Documentation

[Documentation](https://cooarchi.github.io/documentation/) of the political and technological aspects of the cooArchi software development. Not all ideas were realized in the prototype, but as this is an open source effort, everyone is invited to contribute and further develop this tool!

We decided not to have a linear project blog, but a more horizontal presentation of topics in a knowledge base. Realized and unrealized ideas are presented together in this documentation, to invite others to take part in the development of these concepts and the code. The documentation itself is on Github, so you can also contribute to it.

Realized with a [knowledge base template for Jekyll](https://github.com/CloudCannon/base-jekyll-template).
