The capitalization of A in our name can allude to various things. In some cases, using a big A not at the beginning of a word can be a way to break binary language: in various languages it is a way to create an open space including various genders and also keeping open whether an individual, a nonspecific group, or a collective is referred to. 

A large A is also used as an anarchist symbol. cooArchi is anarchist in the sense that it is a technology that tries to shift authority towards communities.
