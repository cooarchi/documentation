We use two Os in our name, to reference cooperatives. While “co” in writing is often use to imply coproduction or cooperation, cooperatives work together horizontally. At the same time our double O shows a reluctancy on our side: while the interface is community-*oriented*, whether it will really serve to build cooperatives has to be proven in practice.
