Triples as a data structure were a big inspiration to us (see: Triples). For the prototype we realized a compromise, the data is understood as triples, but not stored in a triple database. We see triple stores as a hurdle for easy hosting as other ways of data storage are more common. That is why for now we write the triples in a relational database.
