We started the design process with spaces and events of rave culture in mind, because we loved the idea of giving a voice to the various participants, from organizers, to workers and audiences as well as non-participants.

With cooArchi, we want to encourage the existing formal and informal archivists to shift their attention from collecting and sorting documentation, to enabling others to contribute and sort themselves.
