The 2021 prototype of cooArchi is optimized for Desktop view. The main reason for this is the dynamic network visualization, which is hard to do for both Desktop and mobile. One solution would be to only show a static version on some devices. 

Both for input and output we also envision more experimental ways of hardware use in the future. For example, to directly contribute to a cooArchi with capture tools like cameras, scanners, microphones. Also, mobile phone or web protocols for text, like SMS or AcitivityPub could be used to directly receive text.
