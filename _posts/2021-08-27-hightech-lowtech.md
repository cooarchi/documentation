The core idea of cooArchi is very simple: If people write three-part information, these can be represented as nodes and edges. This could even be done on a whiteboard or wall. The digital visualization just serves to give this data a sculptural form, to have it sort itself in clusters and make it traversable like a landscape of information. 

In workshop settings or use cases off a power and digital network grid, this means that cooarching can be done without being connected to the internet or even the server. Mesh networking could serve local gatherings. And offline record keeping on paper can buffer cooArchi entries for later digitization.
