The team of the prototype development discussed a lot about content moderation. As the interface is intended to shift authority from institutions to users (which we call KollektivistA), content moderation is a problematic point, it comes with a power imbalance. Two approaches seemed interesting to us. First, to have no deletion option in the backend, but freedom of listening: KollektivistA would be able to decide what and who they donâ€™t want to see, through blocking others or individual entries. Secondly, to have a deletion option in the backend but to always document the reason for the deletion. Currently we go with the second option, to give those that install a cooArchi (=AdministratA) the possibility to react fast to hate speech or doxxing. 

This approach necessitates trust between KollektivistA and AdministratA. In our community-oriented approach we see this relation as being socially and not technologically negotiated. The AdministratA should care for KollektivistA and document explicitly where they draw the line for unwanted content, for example based on the Berlin Code of Conduct. Also, the AdministratA should make the reasons for deletion transparent.
