The team of the prototype development discussed a lot about content moderation. As the interface is intended to shift authority from institutions to users, content moderation is a problematic point, it comes with a power imbalance. Two approaches seemed interesting to us. First, to have no deletion option in the backend, but freedom of listening: users would be able to decide what and who they donâ€™t want to see, through blocking other users or individual entries. Secondly, to have a deletion option in the backend but to always document the reason for the deletion. Currently we go with the second option, to give those that install a cooArchi the possibility to react fast to hate speech or doxxing. 

This approach necessitates trust between the users and the hosts. In our community-oriented approach we see this relation as being socially and not technologically negotiated. The hosts should care for their guests and document explicitly where they draw the line for unwanted content, for example based on the Berlin Code of Conduct. Also, the hosts should make the reasons for deletion transparent.
