In the future, cooArchi should also work in offline settings. One idea is: 1. a version of the data is kept on the device and can be contributed to 2. when there is net again, new entries are pushed to the online version. 

The data structure of triples also means that other ways of offline cooarching are imaginable, for example having a paper sheet with three columns and collecting handwritten entries to then transcribe them to cooArchi later.
