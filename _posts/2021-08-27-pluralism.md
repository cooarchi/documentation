What people want to archive or document can be very different and complex (see also: Immaterial and ephemeral heritage). Therefore, the interface of cooArchi is aimed at pluralism. 

The design and number of available data fields and how they relate to each other in an interface play a large role in defining what is possible to document with a given database. This design also can have strong normative and hierarchical implications. To counter this, cooArchi follows a strictly pluralist approach to encompass the broadest range of data. For the prototype we decided that the main difference of what is entered are elements and their relation. These then become edges and nodes in the network logic of the archive. We donâ€™t discriminate between data and meta-data, all data in a cooArchi is related in a network way (see also: Contradictions).
