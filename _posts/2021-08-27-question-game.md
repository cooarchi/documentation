The main view of data input is 3 empty fields. Existing entries can be put in there, in order to grow connected information. 

Another interface option would be a question game: the interface would take existing data triples and restructure them as questions. If there is an entry A relation B, a way would be to ask for relations to A, or just generic questions like “What is” A or “Where is” B. The answers then would be saved as new triples into the cooArchi.
