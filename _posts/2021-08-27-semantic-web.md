cooArchi is an experimentation with principles of the semantic. We aim to provide an intuitive way of writing linked data. This is achieved through a focus on data triples. At the same time, most principles of a semantic web stack are left out. These could be implemented through variants of the prototype code or through plugins. This could be relevant to connect a cooArchi to other interfaces in the Linked Open Data context.
