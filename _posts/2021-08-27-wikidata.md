In a way cooArchi is the opposite of Wikidata, compared to this community technology, we donâ€™t have a hierarchical ontology or none at all, our RDFS is minimalistic, the only part of the semantic web principles that we adopted are a kind of data. Still, connecting to Wikidata could be an interesting use case of Linked Open Data with cooArchi, namely importing entities and properties into our model of elements and relations, thus working with Wikidata, but in a spontaneous and pluralistic way, setting a stronger focus on contested meaning and poetic knowledge networks than the encyclopedic approach of Wikipedia and Wikidata.
