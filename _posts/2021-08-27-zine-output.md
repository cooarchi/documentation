An experimental view of a cooArchi would be to print it as a zine, an easy to distribute paper publication. For this, the network of text and media would have to be parsed according to a defined logic and then be put out as a linear document. One such logic could be to build clusters in the network and then print them as paragraphs. That way competing meaning and coproduced narratives would be kept together.
