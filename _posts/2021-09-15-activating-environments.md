In the theory of activating environments, at first, EVERYTHING is (part of) an environment that we (inter)act with and in, that is somehow "designed". 

This design can be more or less activating or passivating, depending on how and how much the designing person(s) think of future users while designing.

With cooArchi we aimed to develop a more activating environment by addressing an intelligent, interested and self-governed future user(group) to empower, more than a lazy and dumb consumer to manipulate.
